## Flappy Owl Game in JavaScript

Welcome to my Flappy Owl game project built with JavaScript! This game showcases my programming skills and creativity in developing an interactive game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird.

## Introduction

In this project, I've created a Flappy Owl game using JavaScript. This game demonstrates my ability to handle game mechanics and interactivity. It offers players a reminiscent of the popular Flappy Bird game.

## Game Overview

Flappy Owl is an endless runner game where players control an owl, guiding it through narrow gaps between tree branches. The goal is to survive as long as possible and collect points for each successful gap clearance.

## Features

- **Responsive Controls**: Players control the owl's flight by clicking or tapping to flap its wings.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Randomly generated tree branches create varying levels of difficulty.
- **Score Tracking**: Points are awarded for successfully passing through tree gaps.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML5 Canvas (for rendering the game)
- CSS

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the game directory in your code editor.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game in your web browser.
2. Click or tap to flap the owl's wings, guiding it between tree branches.
3. Avoid colliding with tree branches or the ground.
4. Each gap cleared earns you points.
5. The game ends when the owl collides with an obstacle.
