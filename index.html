    <h2>      Welcome to my Flappy-owl game! </h2>
    <p class="start-information">
      In this game you will use the Spacebar-key to
      flap the owl up and release the key to let the owl go down.<br>
      Too win you just have to flap the owl inbetween the poles,<br>
      when you lose is when you hit the poles. <br><br>
      The speed will go faster after every passage between the poles and your scores will also go up. <br>
      If you want to play more you just click on the restart button that comes up when you die.<br>
      Good luck!
